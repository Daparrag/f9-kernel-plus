1. Introduction
This document provide a guide line to get users to understand how F9
Microkernel build system works.

2. Glossary
    - $topdir: top level directory of F9 Microkernel directory

3. Overview
The build entry point is Makefile at $topdir. This file does
    - Read platform related information to set
        + Include header files
        + Platform related source files
    - Set output directory
    - Decide which source files to be built
    - Set include header files path
    - Set toolchain compile flags
    - Set configurations for F9 Microkernel
        + The build system refers to .config in whole build process.
          .config is generated via 'make config'.
    - Load build.mk files in the following sub-directories to determine
      source files to be compiled
      $topdir/
        ├── board
        │   └── $(BOARD)
        ├── kernel
        │   └── lib
        ├── loader
        │   └── elf
        ├── platform
        │   └── $(CHIP)
        └── user
    - Build image
    - Burn image

4. Configuration
make config run sequence are
    - $topdir/Makefile:
        + Assign configuration menus from $(KCONFIG_FILES)
    - $topdir/mk/generic.mk
        + config.mk
            = Merge configuration menus to $topdir/build/host/Config.in
        + Compile mconf binary with $topdir/external/kconfig/Makefile.f9
        + Run mconf $topdir/build/host/Config.in to generate $topdir/.config

5. mk directory
Makefile at $topdir heavily leverages files in $topdir/mk directory
during building process.

Here is mk directory tree view
    $topdir/mk/
    ├── config.mk
    ├── generic.mk
    ├── loader.mk
    ├── rules
    │   └── symmap.mk
    ├── target.mk
    └── toolchain.mk

The brief explaination of each file is listed in the following.
    - config.mk
        + Called by generic.mk during make config to generate
          $topdir/build/host/Config.in
    - generic.mk
        + Actually file to
            - Make config
            - Compile files
            - Build image if CONFIG_LOADER is disabled
            - Burn image
            - Set rules for different files such as *.c, *.s, *.bin...
            - Clean up generated files
    - loader.mk
        + Available only if CONFIG_LOADER is enabled
        + build image when CONFIG_LOADER is enabled
    - target.mk
        + Entry point of make all
        + Select link script according to CONFIG_LOADER is set or not.
    - toolchain.mk
        + Set toolchain
        + Set compile flags
    - rules
        + Special rules for F9 Microkernel. $topdir/Makefile will include
          every files in this directory.
        + symmap.mk
            = Generate code for show sampling command in kdb if
              CONFIG_SYMMAP is enabled.

6. Adjustment
    - Verbose output
        + make V=1
    - Platform related
        + $topdir/Makefile
            = BOARD
            = PROJECT
    - Toolchain setting
        + mk/toolchain.mk
    - Compile flags
        + mk/toolchain.mk
